Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    72 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  72
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        139 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                      139 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             134
      Number using O5 output only:               3
      Number using O5 and O6:                    2
  Number of route-thrus:                        15
    Number using O6 output only:                 3
    Number using O5 output only:                12

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    66 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          191
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           119 out of     191   62%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  52 out of     191   27%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          20 out of     191   10%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        74 out of     640   11%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.38

Peak Memory Usage:  4783 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  30 secs
